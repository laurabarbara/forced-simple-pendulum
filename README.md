# Forced Simple Pendulum

Second of two projects for the PHYS6017 Computer Techniques in Physics module of my MPhys programme. The project consists of using an RK45 method to simulate the behaviour of a simple pendulum constrained to a 2D plane, under driving and damping forces, allowing for the study of the evolution of a non-linear chaotic system by varying initial conditions. The simulations were done in Python 3 using the matplotlib, scipy and numpy libraries. The report was produced using Overleaf.
